# To-Do-List

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

The application has three pages with three different routes:

1. The main route for listing the tasks
2. /create for creating a new task
3. /update for updating an existing task
 
A task contains:

- a description to describe the task (multi-lines)
- a "priority" dropdown with the following values (Urgent, Normal, Low)
- a date picker to choose the due date
- a checkbox to know if it is done or not

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
